# What is Linux?

> **Linux** (`/ˈlɪnʊks/` *LIN-uuks*) is a family of open source *Unix*-like *operating systems* based on the *Linux kernel*, an operating system *kernel* first released on September 17, 1991, by *Linus Torvalds*.
> *Linux* is typically packaged as a *Linux distribution* (*distro*), which includes the *kernel* and supporting system software and libraries-most of which are provided by third parties-to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of *Unix* and released under the *copyleft* GPL license.

> Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, **Linux** is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.
> An **operating system** is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the *operating system* manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the *operating system* (**OS**), the software wouldn’t function.

> Linux® is an open source operating system (OS) created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Today, it has a massive user base, and is used in the world’s 500 most powerful supercomputers. Users gravitate toward it for its versatility and security capabilities, among other reasons. The Linux kernel is maintained by a worldwide community of open source enthusiasts and has hundreds of unique distros.

> Linux is an open source operating system (OS) based on Unix. It runs on computers, servers, mobile phones and a wide range of other devices.
>
> Since its invention in 1991, it has become 1 of the most widely used operating systems in the world, providing a free alternative to other operating systems that are proprietary, such as Microsoft Windows and macOS.

> Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds to be a Unix-like alternative to Unix, 1 of the first operating systems ever built. It relies heavily on the Linux kernel for its functionality. In an OS, the kernel is a computer program that allows users to control the system's hardware and software. In addition to the kernel, the Linux OS uses various components, such as system libraries and space utilities, but they all rely on the kernel to communicate and receive commands from users.

> Linux is a computer operating system that is developed using the open source model. Open source software development principles are:
>
> * Transparency
> * Collaboration
> * Releasing early and often
> * Inclusive meritocracy
> * Community
>
> The open source development model also means that improvements come from many different corporate and individual contributors, so the product direction is determined largely by the community of users, rather than by a single development team at a single vendor.
