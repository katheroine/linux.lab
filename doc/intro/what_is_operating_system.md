# What is operating system?

> A modern computer consists of one or more processors, some main memory, disks, printers, a keyboard, a mouse, a display, network interfaces, and various
other input/output devices. All in all, a complex system.oo If every application programmer had to understand how all these things work in detail, no code would ever get written. Furthermore, managing all these components and using them optimally is an exceedingly challenging job. For this reason, computers are equipped with a layer of software called the **operating system**, whose job is to provide user programs with a better, simpler, cleaner, model of the computer and to handle managing all the resources just mentioned.

-- [Andrew Tanenbaum, Herbert Bos, *Modern Operating Systems*](https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Modern%20Operating%20Systems.pdf)

> An **operating system** (**OS**) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
>
> *Time-sharing operating systems* schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.
>
> For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it.
>
> Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer - from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers [..]
>
> An *operating system* is difficult to define, but has been called *the layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications*. Operating systems include the software that is always running, called a *kernel* - but can include other software as well.
>
> The two other types of programs that can run on a computer are system programs - which are associated with the operating system, but may not be part of the kernel - and applications - all other software.

-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

> It is hard to pin down what an **operating system** is other than saying it is the software that runs in kernel mode—and even that is not always true. Part of the problem is that operating systems perform two essentially unrelated functions: providing application programmers (and application programs, naturally) a clean abstract set of resources instead of the messy hardware ones and managing these hardware resources.
