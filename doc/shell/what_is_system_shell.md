# What is system shell?

> An **operating system shell** is a computer program that provides relatively broad and direct access to the system on which it runs. The term shell refers to how it is a relatively thin layer around an operating system.
>
> Most shells are *command-line interface* (*CLI*) programs. Some *graphical user interfaces* (*GUI*) also include shells.

-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))

> The program that users interact with, usually called the **shell** when it is text based and the GUI (Graphical User Interface) - which is pronounced *gooey* - when it uses icons, is actually not part of the operating system, although it uses the operating system to get its work done [...]
>
> Although it is not part of the operating system, it makes heavy use of many operating system features and thus serves as a good example of how the system calls are used. It is also the main interface between a user sitting at his terminal and the operating system, unless the user is
using a graphical user interface.
